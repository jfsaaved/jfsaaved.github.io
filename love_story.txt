Bonu and I

awkward as fuck 24 year old, decided to hcange my life and go to gym

met this girl at work, Talk and flirt a lot at work, suprised my self that i could flirt, it helped that i met a friend whos really enterntaining and learned a thing or two from him
we got pretty close and she ended up asking me out to eat with her mom and sister at 3 am in the morning, really excited, first time this ever happened to me i nmy life
felt she already wanted to get married, night went well

a few days later, i asked her out. we did and it went okay

1 week later I asked again but she declined and offered to go out with other friends, accepted this as getting friendzoned
The next day she asks me to go out with her and her friends, I accepted
mutual friend told me her friend has a crush on me and she did not want to hurt her friend

Decided to ask her out again after a few weeks, went well, no kiss, but too pussy to bring up that conversation
talk more at work, asks her out again, got declined, but finally confessed to me she likes me but does not want to hurt her friend
we decided to leave it at another time

eventually her friend asks me if i have a crush on bonu, i confessed that i did
did not know what to do with information, so i did nothing

her birthday happens, she invited me
me and my friend were the only guys there with like 15 girls. 
was pretty awkward cuz i barely knew anyone else
afterwards friend told me to ask her out again because he thinks she wants me to take action

few weeks go by, decided to ask her out, she accepted
went out, probably our real first date, held hands and all that, i figured her friend told her she can have me

1 week go by, this time she asks me out
we both confessed, and decided to pursue a relationship

we had 3 months of honeymoon in which i was cool with her mom and sister
we didnt had sex, only fake sex. our text however were really playful things, we talked about how much we wanted to have sex with each other
they were okay that we were dating. 

until her mom told her dad that would he be okay with the idea that her dauther is dating someone not muslim but willing to convert
father didnt take it nicely, got mad

bonu and i talked about it, kept our secret relationship, but hide from everybody

eventually, her sister discovered our texts, they forced her to break up with me on my birthday
got hurt pretty bad, next day she told me she wants to keep going, confused and asked to talk about it in person

we decided to continue relationship but not to see each other outside of work for awhile
we also decided to not communicate via any messaging device. she used her friends phone to talk to me when theres an opportunity

we still work together so i was hoping we would see each other at work,
she kept avoiding me, swtiching her schedule with someone else. felt like she was doing it deliberately so i was pretty hurt
friends tell me she is happy, i felt even more hurt, i thought we were still in a relationship so wondered why am i the only one hurting here
came ot the conclusion she moved on

one day i was going on a mini vacation with sister, i asked her friends if i could talk to bonu for a bit, to say my piece and have a clear answer
she told me we will talk after my mini vacation

we finally see each other at work after said mini vacation
she told me she did try to avoid me. her family were really strict on her now, kept reminding her to date a muslim guy
i felt bad that i felt jealous she was happy, told me she felt the same,
she wanted to go out 1 more time and say good bye, i told her to contact me when she is ready

i left the place we worked at due to family reasons
few weeks go by, she contacts me and we finally had our 'last date', it was nice, but sad :(
finally broke up

1 month later
felt miserable and ended up being a fuckboy, went out with a girl who had a crush on me at new work
ended up losing my virginity with her. told her i had no feelings for her and didnt want to pursue a relationship since i just got from a break up.
some reason she was okay with it. decided to vent her about my ex. she starts talking shit about her
started hating this new girl, decided to keep my distance from ehr

1 month later
bonu contacted me out of the blue
wanted to go out watch a movie with me
i accepted as friends

after a few weeks, she contacted again and found a date to go
we did, had fun and all that, she held on to my arms a lot
at the movies, we were watching spiderman, and we kissed. asked her if she wanted to make out in my car
we did, went to my place, had fake sex. then we have our usual break up conversation again
confessed about this other girl, she forgave me, what a nice woman
this time we said it will be the real "last" one, 
i thanked her for everything she has done

after few hours,
she says she takes it back and want to see each other again for 1 last time
i told her, okay

i was going on a long vacation so i asked if we could do it before that
she accepted

we went out on valentines day. we talked about how hard it is to not see each other
i told her if she ever felt lonely, its okay for her to contact me. said our good byes before i go to my trip

1 month and my trip goes by and she hasnt contacted me, i think she moved on
i decided to visit her work one day just to give her some presents i got from my country, 
luckily she was there, told me she was just thinking about me contacting me at that moment
she went on her break, we went in my car, had fake sex and talked about my trip

i gave her gifts and this became a routine for 2 months. i visit her work, 1-3 days a week for 30 mins each day, on her break
we just have our fake sex and have little chats in my car.

now i have my final trip
and something is telling me inside that this time, i really have to say good bye
